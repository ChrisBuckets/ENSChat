# ENSChat

### General Info

#### Website: https://enschat.xyz

Ens Chat is a web based chat application where users can connect their ENS (Ethereum Name Service) domain to chat. All a user needs is metamask and a wallet containing
at least one ENS domain. Once the user connects their metamask to the application, they are able to enter the chatroom and talk to anyone else that owns an ENS domain.

This project used REACT and Socket.io to accomplish real time messaging to any user that wants to connect their MetaMask wallet.
